## About

I am a software engineer originating from England with over five years of experience in full-stack development and digital technology leadership. I excel at taking projects from conception to deployment with a strong focus on user-centered design and scalable architecture. My current role involves leading an engineering team at Heartland Financial, Inc., where we develop customer and employee-facing applications with technologies such as Salesforce, Q2, Azure, OpenAI Services, and more.  

When I'm not coding, I enjoy camping, surfing, playing video games, and watching football ⚽️.
